# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

 I am confident using most of the built-in ruby methods.  I need to learn and practice using more.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

Not very confident at all.  I had trouble understanding this.  I eventually i got the return values I was looking for for each code, but it took a lot of trial and error.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

What are the most commonly used built in Ruby methods?  How frequently do developers have to define their own methods?
